    <p>It’s that time already…. First, let’s talk about the Dragon assignment. As I started the assignment, I thought it should be pretty simple, overwhelming but simple. I’d begin by taking little chunks and just include all of the elements I saw you use and it would be fine. That was my path until I erased the entire project a couple times. I am aware of the version history option, however, I was unable to restore my previous version. I found that using comments to store data while I try other options was really helpful. I also learned not to leave my mouse free, on an article of furniture while working in AWS. My first version did not completely work. I didn’t have the time or experience to know what I was doing wrong to fix bugs. 
The first version was just framework and super basic. I started getting a little nervous as time progressed and neared the final version’s deadline. Finally, because you said we had to have someone look at our site, I asked some folks from Usability Testing to help me out. That was likely the best decision I have made since I started this class! Why, because they took this class a couple semesters ago and were able to explain the filing system. For me, I needed to be able to ask questions but I will get back to that after I explain the final version.

  <p>I showed my draft to my classmates and complained of how basic it was. They said, “it was because I was just beginning in this field not to mention, during Covid.” I was able to ask them some very basic questions and discuss my website. The action of talking about what I was doing was extremely helpful for me. I was able to see many errors and fix them such as with my articles and nav links. On the final version, I was able to begin with a basic understanding of the filing tree and that opened literally every door in AWS. Once I understood the filing tree, I was able to modify elements and apply changes I saw you implement such as the photo cycle fx. In the end of my project I was happy with being able to apply the elements I wanted to use. I am excited to learn more in this field! I wish I had more time to spend on this project so I could make it perfect. I have OCD fiercely, so this class is a fun challenge for me. I was able to see myself grow and gain skills to become more marketable.
